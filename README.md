* Added:
	* Drench
	* Pin the Bow
	* Kitty Bejeweled
	* Color Scale
	* Color Scale 2D
* Added the kitty images to the assets folder (the images on postimage are gone).
* Got a black knight chess piece for a favicon
* Updated Drench to be more responsive

Things I need to do:

* Add a contact me/about me section
* Add the arch inkscape extension
* Write about my pothole reporter app and it's pitfalls </3
* Add the star rating
* pyramids
